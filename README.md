# Linh Tran's Porfolio

## Description

This week's challenge allows us to utilize our skills build our very own portfolio page showcasing our projects as the course progresses. It was built using skills including but not limited to flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

See below for the direct link to the live page:

The following video demonstrates what the web application looks like once the user navigates to the live page. This also demonstrates how the grid adapts to the screen size as the browser size is adjusted.
